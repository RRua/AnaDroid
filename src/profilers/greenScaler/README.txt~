You have to have SDK installed. 
You must have an emulator like one of the PNGs. Real device is fine. 

run push.sh from push_to_phone folder. This will installs necessary scripts to run and collect measurements. 

How to run the GreenTestGen:

go to mutator directory and: python mutator_main.py script.sh

Or run run.sh (This is helpful when generating test cases using emulator)
